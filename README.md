# agora-themes
UI theme bundles for the Agora desktop environment

This repository will eventually hold two UI themes for Agora, currently codenamed Rhodium and Argentum.

Rhodium will be a theme inspired by Rhapsody DR2/Mac OS X Server, a platinum-like theme. Argentum will
be more modern, reminiscent of the UI theme of Mac OS X v10.5, "Leopard". In both cases, the themes will
be metrically identical -- the same NSView subclass will take the same amount of screen area in either
theme. In neither case will the theme be a direct copy or clone of the UI that inspired it.

Metric compatibility with existing GNUstep applications is not a priority; since any given app will need
changes to fit into Agora anyway, adjusting the UI theme to use the new look is also going to be a given.
There aren't that many GNUstep applications anyway, so it's not that important to us.

Both themes will share a single icon set, most likely derived from an existing one from GNOME.
